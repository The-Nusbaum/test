# A Brief History of Valence, By Cashmere the Scribe - Jolus, 1387 rr
Valence is a land of intruigue and mystery. Mighty Magics and arcane contrivances. The gods are petty, the guilds are plenty. More importantly it is a place of constance strife. Valence was once a peaceful place, though none still live who remember it as such.

Minor squabbles between the elder races, The Tel'Quessir and the Gnomes did not merit epics or remembrances, nor did the constant threat of orcs or trolls on the fringes of either society. The first disturbance to this mostly peaceful existence was the arrival or the Dwarves. Arriving suddenly, and claiming lands the gnomes held dear, a war raged for hundreds of years between the stout, stubborn Dwarves and an alliance between the Elves and the Gnomes. With time the violence ebbed, peace settled, and an equilibrium was achieved. Eventually relations became amiable, and trade routes were established. 

All was well for a time.

## circa 8000 years ago

Driven from their lands in the north, a new threat emerged. A wave of brutish humanoids, taller than dwarves, but stockier than elves. Humans had arrived. Fleeing before a tide of orcs, at first the Elves and gnomes welcomed them as refugees. The Dwarves maintained a watchful eye from their mountain strongholds. It rapidly became apparent that this was not a simple route of a few small tribes, this was a wholesale migration of an entire people. As the numbers rapidly increased, so did tensions. When the orc hordes finally reached the Lands of Valence en mass the stage was set for a terrible conflagration. Elven and Gnomish society was destroyed in the coming conflict. Only the dwarves remained whole, as they were reticent to venture to the surface and deal with these issues as they simply did not have to. Ultimately, however, it was the mobilization of thousands of dwarven soldiers that halted the orcish tide and then quelled the infighting between the remnants of Elven and Gnomish societies and the newly arrived, resource hungry Humans.

The violence halted, or at least lessened, the Elves and Gnomes were left to pick up the pieces of their societies, the Humans were attempting to establish a new one. Tensions between the three races were high as yet, and this resulted in infighting. Not being able to agree on the structure of their new societies, both peoples fractured, creating distinct cultural differences in the factions to come, as well as physiological ones, as the new societies were formed and the various races dispersed out into the wider world and it's environs.
A relative peace returned. Kingdoms rose and fell, wars raged, the orcs returned and were sent back from whence they came.... time passed

## Circa 600 years ago

Tordal, the God of Order and Technology watched the prime material plane from his home in the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus. He was terribly disappointed with the progress of his endeavors to bring order to the poor beings living in that chaotic quagmire. He would help them, if only they would see. In fact, he would make them. They would appreciate it when it was done...

From under mount Keres, a dwarven stronghold, a portal opened and began spewing out mechanical creatures bent on violence. Keres was one of the stronger dwarven kingdoms, it fell to the onslought from within in a matter of hours,dead down to the last beardless child. From here an avatar of Tordal directed the invasion of Valence.

The combined but scattered might of Valence, Elves, Humans, Gnomes, Halflings, Dwarves... All stood before the mechanical armies of Tordal. They had victories, yes. But with every victory new mechanisms faced the troops in battle. For over a decade, things were going very poorly. How do you fight an enemy that has no fear of death? An army that moves with synchronicity?

## Overwhelming force.

Despite the protests of the more noble aspects of society, the undesirable enemies of decent society enacted a plan that would ultimately free Valence from the yoke of unyielding order. Archliches, Vampires, Necromancers, Thaumaturges, all manner of dark beings came together and, workign in concert, raised an incredible amount of the dead. The risen dead clashed with the mechanical drones of Tordal all across Valence. While the battles were not decisive, the invasion's progress was halted. After months of this, Tordal, in a fit of rage that sunk the mountain of Keres beneath the surface as countless drones across thousands of battlefields simultaneously fell to scrap, the will that drove them suddenly lashing out with anger and abandoning them. With his progress halted, his invasion brought nothing but chaos, which the god of order could simply not abide.

The unquiet dead did not simply return to rest beneath the ground. Rather than be repulsed, the humans, at this point still the most populous of races, welcomed the risen dead as heroes. In fact, it was suggested that if they could fight, they could work. With their willingness to accept the undead into the workforce, opinions continued to shift. While not capable of skilled tasks, they were eminently capable of performing crude, simple laborious tasks. Centuries passed, the undead remained a fixture in most of the human controlled lands. The faithful would guard their hallowed halls even after they had joined their deities. Families could hire teams of them to plow fields, or haul loads that they would otherwise have to spend more than they could afford or do it themselves at great risk. Reasonably strong and reliable, entire businesses sprang up for the production, maintenance, and use of the dead.

In the non human lands, this was not so joyously accepted. Many of the dead were elves or dwarves who had died in battle, or even been laid to rest centuries before. The indignity of what had been done to their remote tombs and history sat poorly with them, and while they could not deny the effectiveness of the ploy, they found the continued use of the dead unconscionable.

This was not the only ill effect of the dead, however. When you can hire 10 bodies to perform simple tasks for the price of one person, what use have you of unskilled labor? Suddenly, not having a skill became a death sentence as the ability to earn income for the poor and undereducated became near 0. It is said that the "Beggar's Guild" is the only guild older than the "Harlot's guild," and even then not by long. To be a member of the beggar's guild is to have no guild at all. Guilds have become, at least in human lands, the focal point of daily life. Any skill that can be of value, and many that aren't (but cannot be performed by the dead), have guilds that negotiate with prospective employers and buyers to ensure reasonable pay. This arrangement is both a boon and a bane to human society. On the one hand, bureaucracy is rampant. On the other it has led to a renaissance of artisinal crafts, food, magical study, and technology.  

Only on the fringes of society can one be free of the guilds, but for how long?
